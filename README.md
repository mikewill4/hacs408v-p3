# HACS408V Project #3: Tweet Analysis w/ Twitter API
twaces is a project for HACS408V, a data visualization course at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). This course is also part of the Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students (ACES) Minor program. In this project, I will utilize Twitter's API to analyze tweets referencing either UMD or ACES. From this data I will attempt to create visualizations for the following:
* A spatial graph that displays where UMD/ACES is mentioned most around the world
* Sentiment analysis on tweets that mention UMD/ACES that will reveal overall public opinions
* Social graphs of the most popular users that tweet about UMD/ACES
* Potentially more!
## Setup
- [x] Create Twitter developer account
- [x] Create new project and get API key
- [x] Install Tweepy
## Data collection
- [x] Create multiple complex search queries for both ACES and UMD
- [x] Create scripts to run initial queries for last 30 days worth of data
- [x] Export data to JSON files
- [ ] For more data: wait a week and then pull data from previous week
## Spatial Analysis
- [ ] Extract tweets with location data
- [ ] Create a world bubble map
- [ ] Create a country bubble map (United States)
## Sentiment Analysis
- [ ] TBD
## Social Analysis
- [ ] TBD
