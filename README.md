# HACS408V Project #3: Tweet Analysis w/ Twitter API
twaces is a project for HACS408V, a data visualization course at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD). This course is also part of the Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students (ACES) Minor program. In this project, I will utilize Twitter's API to analyze tweets referencing either UMD or ACES. From this data I will attempt to create visualizations for the following:
* A spatial graph that displays where UMD/ACES is mentioned most around the world
* Sentiment analysis on tweets that mention UMD/ACES that will reveal overall public opinions
* Social graphs of the most popular users that tweet about UMD/ACES
* Potentially more!
